# AWS Serverless Feedback API

A fully serverless feedback management application built on AWS using **Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**. The project demonstrates how AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway can be combined to build scalable REST APIs without provisioning or managing servers.

The application provides a lightweight web interface where users can submit feedback and retrieve previously submitted feedback. Feedback is stored as JSON documents in Amazon S3, while the frontend is hosted as a static website and delivered through Amazon CloudFront.

Unlike traditional web applications that require dedicated backend servers, all business logic executes on demand inside AWS Lambda, enabling automatic scaling and reduced operational overhead.

```

The application follows a simple serverless architecture where frontend assets are delivered through CloudFront, API requests are handled by API Gateway, Lambda contains the application logic, and Amazon S3 stores submitted feedback.

# Application Features

## Submit Feedback

Users can submit feedback through a simple web interface.

Each submission includes:

* Name
* Feedback message
* Automatically generated timestamp

Every submission is stored as an individual JSON document inside Amazon S3.

---

## Retrieve Feedback

The application retrieves every stored feedback object from Amazon S3 and returns the collection sorted by submission time.

Role-aware behavior is implemented:

### Administrator

Administrators receive:

* Name
* Feedback
* Timestamp

### Regular Users

Regular authenticated users receive:

* Anonymous name
* Feedback
* Timestamp

This demonstrates simple authorization logic using Cognito JWT claims without exposing personally identifiable information.

---

# REST API

## Submit Feedback

**POST /feedback**

Request

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "feedback": "Great application!"
}
```

Response

```json
{
  "message": "Object stored successfully in S3"
}
```

---

## Retrieve Feedback

**GET /feedback**

Returns all stored feedback ordered by newest first.

Administrator response:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "feedback": "Great application!",
    "timestamp": "2026-06-15T10:30:00Z"
  }
]
```

Regular user response:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Anonymous",
    "feedback": "Great application!",
    "timestamp": "2026-06-15T10:30:00Z"
  }
]
```

# Storage Design

Feedback is stored as individual JSON objects within Amazon S3.

Object structure:

```
feedbacks/
├── 9fd0d95d.json
├── 2e431acf.json
├── 8ab41c22.json
```

Each object contains:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "feedback": "Great application!",
  "timestamp": "2026-06-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

Storing each submission independently simplifies retrieval and eliminates concurrent write conflicts.

---

# Security Design

The implementation follows AWS security best practices.

Implemented security measures include:

* Least-privilege IAM permissions
* Private Amazon S3 buckets
* HTTPS delivery through CloudFront
* JWT authentication using Amazon Cognito
* Server-side role validation
* No embedded AWS credentials
* Secure service-to-service communication using IAM roles

---

# Monitoring

Application monitoring is provided through Amazon CloudWatch.

Captured information includes:

* Lambda execution logs
* Request information
* Error messages
* Execution duration
* Debug output

CloudWatch logs simplify troubleshooting and operational monitoring during development.

---

# Infrastructure as Code

All AWS resources are provisioned using Terraform.

Provisioned resources include:

* Amazon API Gateway
* AWS Lambda
* Amazon S3
* Amazon CloudFront
* Amazon Cognito
* IAM Roles
* CloudWatch

Using Infrastructure as Code enables repeatable deployments without manual AWS Console configuration.
